# Privacy_Preserving_Formation_Control_with_Collision_Avoidance
This repository contains the Python simulation for the research paper titled "Privacy-Preserving Formation Control for Multi-Agent Systems with Collision Avoidance". The project aims to validate the proposed privacy-preserving formation control scheme, which is based on the Paillier homomorphic cryptosystem.
